# Add Colour to images using  U-Net and GAN Tutorial



---This task needed a lot of human input and hardcoding several years ago but now the whole process can be done end-to-end with the power of AI and deep learning. You might think that you need huge amount of data or long training times to train your model from scratch for this task but in the last few weeks I worked on this and tried many different model architectures, loss functions, training strategies, etc. and finally developed an efficient strategy to train such a model, using the latest advances in deep learning, on a rather small dataset and with really short training times. In this article, I'm going to explain what I did to make this happen, including the code!, and the strategies that helped and also those that were not useful. Before that, I will explain the colorization problem and a give you a short review of what has been done in recent years. 




Notice that _**x**_ is given to both models which is the condition we introduce two both players of this game. Actually, we are not going to feed a "n" dimensional vector of random noise to the generator as you might expect but the noise is introduced in the form of dropout layers (there is something cool about it which you will read in the last section of the article) in the generator architecture.

### Loss function weÂ optimize

The earlier loss function helps to produce good-looking colorful images that seem real, but to further help the models and introduce some supervision in our task, we combine this loss function with L1 Loss (you might know L1 loss as mean absolute error) of the predicted colors compared with the actual colors:

![L1 loss](./files/l1_loss.jpg)

If we use L1 loss alone, the model still learns to colorize the images but it will be conservative and most of the time uses colors like "gray" or "brown" because when it doubts which color is the best, it takes the average and uses these colors to reduce the L1 loss as much as possible (it is similar to the blurring effect of L1 or L2 loss in super resolution task). Also, the L1 Loss is preferred over L2 loss (or mean squared error) because it reduces that effect of producing gray-ish images. So, our combined loss function will be:





```python

```

### 1.4- Discriminator

The architecture of our discriminator is rather straight forward. This code implements a model by stacking blocks of Conv-BatchNorm-LeackyReLU to decide whether the input image is fake or real. Notice that the first and last blocks do not use normalization and the last block has no activation function (it is embedded in the loss function we will use).


```python
class PatchDiscriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_c, num_filters=64, n_down=3):
        super().__init__()
        model = [self.get_layers(input_c, num_filters, norm=False)]
        model += [self.get_layers(num_filters * 2 ** i, num_filters * 2 ** (i + 1), s=1 if i == (n_down-1) else 2) 
                          for i in range(n_down)] # the 'if' statement is taking care of not using
                                                  # stride of 2 for the last block in this loop
        model += [self.get_layers(num_filters * 2 ** n_down, 1, s=1, norm=False, act=False)] # Make sure to not use normalization or
                                                                                             # activation for the last layer of the model
        self.model = nn.Sequential(*model)                                                   
        
    def get_layers(self, ni, nf, k=4, s=2, p=1, norm=True, act=True): # when needing to make some repeatitive blocks of layers,
        layers = [nn.Conv2d(ni, nf, k, s, p, bias=not norm)]          # it's always helpful to make a separate method for that purpose
        if norm: layers += [nn.BatchNorm2d(nf)]
        if act: layers += [nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, True)]
        return nn.Sequential(*layers)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)
```

Let's take a look at its blocks:


```python
PatchDiscriminator(3)
```

And its output shape:


```python
discriminator = PatchDiscriminator(3)
dummy_input = torch.randn(16, 3, 256, 256) # batch_size, channels, size, size
out = discriminator(dummy_input)
out.shape
```

We are using a "Patch" Discriminator here. Okay, what is it?! In a vanilla discriminator, the model outputs one number (a scaler) which represents how much the model thinks the input (which is the whole image) is real (or fake). In a patch discriminator, the model outputs one number for every patch of say 70 by 70 pixels of the input image and for each of them decides whether it is fake or not separately. Using such a model for the task of colorization seems reasonable to me because the local changes that the model needs to make are really important and maybe deciding on the whole image as in vanilla discriminator cannot take care of the subtleties of this task. Here, the model's output shape is 30 by 30 but it does not mean that our patches are 30 by 30. The actual patch size is obtained when you compute the receptive field of each of these 900 (30 multiplied by 30) output numbers which in our case will be 70 by 70.

### 1.5- GANÂ Loss

This is a handy class we can use to calculate the GAN loss of our final model. In the __init__ we decide which kind of loss we're going to use (which will be "vanilla" in our project) and register some constant tensors as the "real" and "fake" labels. Then when we call this module, it makes an appropriate tensor full of zeros or ones (according to what we need at the stage) and computes the loss.


```python
class GANLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, gan_mode='vanilla', real_label=1.0, fake_label=0.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_buffer('real_label', torch.tensor(real_label))
        self.register_buffer('fake_label', torch.tensor(fake_label))
        if gan_mode == 'vanilla':
            self.loss = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
        elif gan_mode == 'lsgan':
            self.loss = nn.MSELoss()
    
    def get_labels(self, preds, target_is_real):
        if target_is_real:
            labels = self.real_label
        else:
            labels = self.fake_label
        return labels.expand_as(preds)
    
    def __call__(self, preds, target_is_real):
        labels = self.get_labels(preds, target_is_real)
        loss = self.loss(preds, labels)
        return loss
```

### 1.x Model Initialization

In the TowardsDataScince article, I didn't explain this function. Here is our logic to initialize our models. We are going to initialize the weights of our model with a mean of 0.0 and standard deviation of 0.02 which are the proposed hyperparameters in the article:


```python
def init_weights(net, init='norm', gain=0.02):
    
    def init_func(m):
        classname = m.__class__.__name__
        if hasattr(m, 'weight') and 'Conv' in classname:
            if init == 'norm':
                nn.init.normal_(m.weight.data, mean=0.0, std=gain)
            elif init == 'xavier':
                nn.init.xavier_normal_(m.weight.data, gain=gain)
            elif init == 'kaiming':
                nn.init.kaiming_normal_(m.weight.data, a=0, mode='fan_in')
            
            if hasattr(m, 'bias') and m.bias is not None:
                nn.init.constant_(m.bias.data, 0.0)
        elif 'BatchNorm2d' in classname:
            nn.init.normal_(m.weight.data, 1., gain)
            nn.init.constant_(m.bias.data, 0.)
            
    net.apply(init_func)
    print(f"model initialized with {init} initialization")
    return net

def init_model(model, device):
    model = model.to(device)
    model = init_weights(model)
    return model
```

### 1.6- Putting everything together

This class brings together all the previous parts and implements a few methods to take care of training our complete model. Let's investigate it.Â 

In the __init__ we define our generator and discriminator using the previous functions and classes we defined and we also initialize them with init_model function which I didn't explain here but you can refer to my GitHub repository to see how it works. Then we define our two loss functions and the optimizers of the generator and discriminator.Â 

The whole work is being done in optimize method of this class. First and only once per iteration (batch of training set) we call the module's forward method and store the outputs in fake_color variable of the class.Â 

Then, we first train the discriminator by using backward_D method in which we feed the fake images produced by generator to the discriminator (make sure to detach them from the generator's graph so that they act as a constant to the discriminator, like normal images) and label them as fake. Then we feed a batch of real images from training set to the discriminator and label them as real. We add up the two losses for fake and real and take the average and then call the backward on the final loss.Â 
Now, we can train the generator. In backward_G method we feed the discriminator the fake image and try to fool it by assigning real labels to them and calculating the adversarial loss. As I mentioned earlier, we use L1 loss as well and compute the distance between the predicted two channels and the target two channels and multiply this loss by a coefficient (which is 100 in our case) to balance the two losses and then add this loss to the adversarial loss. Then we call the backward method of the loss.

### 1.xx Utility functions

These functions were nor included in the explanations of the TDS article. These are just some utility functions to log the losses of our network and also visualize the results during training. So here you can check them out:

### 1.7- TrainingÂ function

I hope this code is self-explanatory. Every epoch takes about 4 minutes on not a powerful GPU as Nvidia P5000. So if you are using 1080Ti or higher, it will be much faster.


```python
def train_model(model, train_dl, epochs, display_every=200):
    data = next(iter(val_dl)) # getting a batch for visualizing the model output after fixed intrvals
    for e in range(epochs):
        loss_meter_dict = create_loss_meters() # function returing a dictionary of objects to 
        i = 0                                  # log the losses of the complete network
        for data in tqdm(train_dl):
            model.setup_input(data) 
            model.optimize()
            update_losses(model, loss_meter_dict, count=data['L'].size(0)) # function updating the log objects
            i += 1
            if i % display_every == 0:
                print(f"\nEpoch {e+1}/{epochs}")
                print(f"Iteration {i}/{len(train_dl)}")
                log_results(loss_meter_dict) # function to print out the losses
                visualize(model, data, save=False) # function displaying the model's outputs

model = MainModel()
train_model(model, train_dl, 100)
```

Every epoch takes about 3 to 4 minutes on Colab. After about 20 epochs you should see some reasonable results.

Okay. I let the model train for some longer (about 100 epochs). Here are the results of our baseline model:

![baseline](./files/baseline.png)

As you can see, although this baseline model has some basic understanding of some most common objects in images like sky, trees,Â â¦ its output is far from something appealing and it cannot decide on the color of rare objects. It also displays some color spillovers and circle-shaped mass of color (center of first image of second row) which is not good at all. So, it seems like that with this small dataset we cannot get good results with this strategy. **Therefore, we change our strategy!**

## 2- A new strategyâ-âthe finalÂ model

Here is the focus of this article and where I'm going to explain what I did to overcome the last mentioned problem. Inspired by an idea in Super Resolution literature, I decided to pretrain the generator separately in a supervised and deterministic manner to avoid the problem of "the blind leading the blind" in the GAN game where neither generator nor discriminator knows anything about the task at the beginning of training.Â 

Actually I use pretraining in two stages: 1- The backbone of the generator (the down sampling path) is a pretrained model for classification (on ImageNet) 2- The whole generator will be pretrained on the task of colorization with L1 loss.

In fact, I'm going to use a pretrained ResNet18 as the backbone of my U-Net and to accomplish the second stage of pretraining, we are going to train the U-Net on our training set with only L1 Loss. Then we will move to the combined adversarial and L1 loss, as we did in the previous section.

### 2.1- Using a new generator

Building a U-Net with a ResNet backbone is not something trivial so I'll use fastai library's Dynamic U-Net module to easily build one. You can simply install fastai with pip or conda. Here's the link to the [documentation](https://docs.fast.ai/).

---
#### Update Jan 8th, 2022: <br> 
You need to install fastai version 2.4 for the following lines code to run w/o errors.
<br><br><br>

```python
# pip install fastai==2.4
from fastai.vision.learner import create_body
from torchvision.models.resnet import resnet18
from fastai.vision.models.unet import DynamicUnet
```


```python
def build_res_unet(n_input=1, n_output=2, size=256):
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    body = create_body(resnet18, pretrained=True, n_in=n_input, cut=-2)
    net_G = DynamicUnet(body, n_output, (size, size)).to(device)
    return net_G
```

That's it! With just these few lines of code you can build such a complex model easily. create_body function loads the pretrained weights of the ResNet18 architecture and cuts the model to remove the last two layers (GlobalAveragePooling and a Linear layer for the ImageNet classification task). Then, DynamicUnet uses this backbone to build a U-Net with the needed output channels (2 in our case) and with an input size of 256.

### 2.2 Pretraining the generator for colorization task


```python
def pretrain_generator(net_G, train_dl, opt, criterion, epochs):
    for e in range(epochs):
        loss_meter = AverageMeter()
        for data in tqdm(train_dl):
            L, ab = data['L'].to(device), data['ab'].to(device)
            preds = net_G(L)
            loss = criterion(preds, ab)
            opt.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            opt.step()
            
            loss_meter.update(loss.item(), L.size(0))
            
        print(f"Epoch {e + 1}/{epochs}")
        print(f"L1 Loss: {loss_meter.avg:.5f}")

net_G = build_res_unet(n_input=1, n_output=2, size=256)
opt = optim.Adam(net_G.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
criterion = nn.L1Loss()        
pretrain_generator(net_G, train_dl, opt, criterion, 20)
#torch.save(net_G.state_dict(), "res18-unet.pt")
```

With this simple function, we pretrain the generator for 20 epochs and then we save its weights. This will take about one hour on Colab. In the following section, we will use this model as the generator for our GAN and train the whole network as before:

### 2.3 Putting everything together, again!


```python
net_G = build_res_unet(n_input=1, n_output=2, size=256)
net_G.load_state_dict(torch.load("res18-unet.pt", map_location=device))
model = MainModel(net_G=net_G)
train_model(model, train_dl, 20)
```
